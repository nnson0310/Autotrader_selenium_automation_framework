  "description": "When selling a car, the description can determine whether or not a buyer takes the next step in the purchasing process and comes down to the dealership for a closer look. Today, a compelling vehicle description is what initially sells the car. The 2019 Cox Automotive Car Buyer Journey Study found that buyers are increasingly making more decisions based on online research before visiting dealerships. As a result, buyers are visiting fewer dealerships but are more likely to buy once they test drive."
